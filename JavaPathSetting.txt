🧠 1. What are Environment Variables?
	- Think of environment variables as global settings that your computer uses to find things or remember important information.
	- 💡 Example:
		- Imagine your computer is a big office building.
		- If you tell everyone “the printer is in Room 203,” people can find it easily.
		- If you don’t tell them, they’ll say, “I don’t know where the printer is!”
		Here, environment variables are like those office signs — they tell Windows where to find programs and files.
		
⚙️ 2. What is JAVA_HOME?
	JAVA_HOME is an environment variable that tells your computer where Java is installed.(JAVA_HOME = C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17)
	So when Notepad++ or any other program says,
		“Hey, I need Java — where is it?”
			- Windows looks at JAVA_HOME and says,
				- “It’s right here → C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17”
	If JAVA_HOME is empty or missing, programs (like Notepad++ or Eclipse) can’t find Java, and you see the error:
		- >>> ERROR: JAVA_HOME property is empty

🛠️ 3. What is the “Path” Variable?
	Path is another environment variable — but this one is special.
	It tells Windows where to look for programs when you type their names in Command Prompt.
	💡 Example:
		- If you type javac in Command Prompt, Windows doesn’t know what that means — unless you tell it where javac.exe lives.
		- By adding this line to your Path:
			- %JAVA_HOME%\bin
		you’re telling Windows:
			- “When someone types javac, go look inside the bin folder of the Java installation.”
		So now you can run javac or java from anywhere in your system.

🧱 4. What are “System Variables” vs “User Variables”?
	When you opened “Environment Variables,” you saw two sections:
	| Type                 | Applies To                     | Example                           |
	| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
	| **User variables**   | Only your Windows account      | Temporary settings for one person |
	| **System variables** | The whole computer (all users) | `JAVA_HOME`, `Path`               |
	
	So when we set JAVA_HOME in System Variables, it means every user and every program on the computer can find Java.
	
🔍 5. Why do you get the error?
	Because:
		- Notepad++ tried to compile Java code,
		- It looked for Java using the variable JAVA_HOME,
		- But it was empty or not set,
		- So Notepad++ couldn’t find javac (the Java compiler).
	Hence:
		ERROR: JAVA_HOME property is empty
	Once you set JAVA_HOME correctly, Notepad++ can locate Java and compile your .java file properly ✅
